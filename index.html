Hello. You shoud be able to type Okay, I can type now. Had to download some extra stuff. yay What about Yash? i dont know why they can't join Does he need to have VSCode installed first? yes Ok, I think that's why. I don't think he has it on his computer
yet. oh Hey what time zone are you in again btw? the same time zone the hackathon organizers are in. its 2:48 for me. Oh, I'm pst so it's 11.48 am over here. ok put all files in nhacks/www there are seperate folders for css, image, and javascript files.
and put any html files in www wait so how do i see the files? (lol sorry I'm kinda confused) OH YASH IS here yeah im here on the left of the screen, i see a thing that says session details and contacts and help. right of that you should see a bunch of
icons, click the top one. woooohoooo nvm I see the file thing now there are a lot so it might look confusing, but the only folder you have to worry about is www All right. I am working on code for med reminder right nowusing a diff app called pycharm
python doesn't run in cordova. <object data="" type=""></object> oh ok what does ok ill try javascript. Also, is there a language converter where I type it all in python then convert to javascript ok im not using libraries just basic if else statements,
string oeprators, and a few variables. those are all pretty easy in javascript if(thing){do this}else{do this} to make variables just to var text="this is some text" its like python but you need var in front. I think there is, it won't convert any libraries
you use tho. cause pyhton is kinda the only one ik besides basic HTML/css javascript. Its pretty similar to python, but the syntax is just a little different. You can help with the html if you want too. either way, it should be ok to start in python &
convert or write it in js first for if-else and variables, they're pretty similar good point. btw, if we're decided on HealthBot as a name, I could get started on a logo. I'm not a pro with graphic design, but I should be able to make something kind of
simple. great! ok, i'll get started on that then and try and see if I can work on the home page too. I might write the code in repl first tho, just because I'm more comfortable with that than VSCode. But we can still copy and paste the code into VSCode
right? yes Awesome, also we can upload images/graphics into vscode too right? ok, cuz i'll probably be doing some img src stuff im pretty sure you can all programming languages are 90% similar. if you understand the underlying structures its easy to switch
between them alright, so we all know what we're doing? ooh that sounds great! I'll get started on my stuff soon, I have to go eat lunch now ok Nice, ok see y'all soon yeah. i just found a awesome cordova plugin that lets you do phone notifications. You
can schedule the time too like for medications yo, i found a cordova plugin that lets you call people, llike emergency contacts
